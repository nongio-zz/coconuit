This project aims to realize a lightweight, flexible and extensible Cocoa Framework to create Multitouch and more in general Tangible apps.

It implements the basic gestures recognition and offers the possibility for each user to define and setup its owns gestures easily. Because of its nature we hope this framework will work good with Quartz and Core Animation to realize fun and useful apps. It offers also a lot of off-the-shelf widgets, ready to quick realize your own NUI app.
